# Vanishing Point Detection for Road Alignment
## Method
- Crop needed area as road, like bottom half
- Smoothing image to denoise
- Edge detection using canny method
- Line detectino using hough method
- Pick the two lines that are most likely road boundaries
- Calculate crossing point of the two lines as the vanishing point

## Process Example
### Detected Edge


### Detected Road Boundaries and Vanishing Point
